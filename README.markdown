# PNG-Dedup
## Basics
First place the PNGs into a folder named `in` in the current directory.  
If an `./in` folder does not exist, the program will quit early.  
An `out` folder will be created if there is not one.  

__WARNING__ : the program will the clear `./out` folder!  
```yaml
.               # the current directory
 /in            # make this folder, fill it with the PNG sequence
 /out           # if it exists, folder will get cleared , else made
 /png-dedup.exe # the executable should be placed here, and called from this directory
```

## Notes
PNG-Dedup was made for my own use, use at your own discression.
